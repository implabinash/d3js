# d3js

This repo is my personal learning space for exploring data visualization with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
I'll be creating and experimenting with various charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations.

## Why D3.js?

D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations using web standards like SVG, HTML, and CSS.
